## Typescript Classes

<br />

<h3>TypeScript adds types and visibility modifiers to JavaScript classes.</h3>

<ul>
    <li>
        <h4>Members: Types</h4
        <p> -> The members of a class (properties & methods) are typed using type annotations, similar to variables.</P>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h4>Members: Visibility</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>public - (default) allows access to the class member from anywhere</li>
            <li>private - only allows access to the class member from within the class</li>
            <li>protected - allows access to the class member from itself and any classes that inherit it, which is covered in the inheritance section below</li>
        </ol>
    </li>
</ul>
